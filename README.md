A collection of codes for analysing output of MagIC code: https://magic-sph.github.io/

They are free to use under GPLv3. They are heavily dependent on the python analysis package
that comes with MagIC. Since they are mostly for my own use, they might not be very user
friendly and might need significant modifications for anyone else.
